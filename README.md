### Introduction

The aim of this project was to build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

### Screenshots to represent the project

### Tasks in the project

### Link to the App

A link to the live, hosted version of the app: [https://seresbeata.github.io/achievement-5/](https://seresbeata.github.io/achievement-5/)

### Technologies

### Dependencies

### Development mode

Use `npm run start` to run the app in development mode. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000/achievement-5". The application automatically reload in case of changes any of the source files.

### Build

Build the app for production to the build folder, with the following terminal command:

`npm run build`

### User stories and features

#### FEATURE 1: FILTER EVENTS BY CITY

_As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city._

- **Scenario 1:** When user hasn’t searched for a specific city, show upcoming events from all cities.

  - **Given** the main page has been opened,
  - **when** user does not search for any city,
  - **then** a list of all available events for all the cities is shown.

- **Scenario 2:** User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.

  - **Given** the main page has been opened,
  - **when** user starts to type in the city textbox,
  - **then** a list of cities (suggestions) that match the typed one is shown.

- **Scenario 3:** User can select a city from the suggested list.

  - **Given** the user has typed a city in the city textbox and the list of suggested cities is showing;,
  - **when** user selects a city from the list,
  - **then** a list of all available events for the selected city is shown.

#### FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS

_As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event._

- **Scenario 1:** By default, only minimal information about the event that caught the user's attention is visible.

  - **Given** the events have been loaded,
  - **when** a user clicks show more details button on the event, that caught the user's attention,
  - **then** the event is expanded and the rest of the information is shown.

- **Scenario 2:** The user has clicked show details button and now wants to show less details to scroll quicker.

  - **Given** the events have been loaded,
  - **when** user clicks hide details button,
  - **then** the additional information about the selected event is become hidden.

#### FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS

_As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once._

- **Scenario 1:** When a user opens the app and hasn’t specified the number of events.

  - **Given** the main page has been opened,
  - **when** the users hasn’t specified the number of events,
  - **then** a default list of 10 events are displayed on the page.

- **Scenario 2:** When a user wants to change the events shown to a higher number of events.

  - **Given** the default of 10 events has been displayed to the user,
  - **when** the user specifies a higher number of events than the default,
  - **then** the list is updated and new events are displayed to the user.

- **Scenario 3:** When a user wants to change the events to show less than the default number of events.

  - **Given** the default of 10 events has been displayed to the user,
  - **when** the user specifies a lower number of events than the default,
  - **then** the list is updated and fewer events are displayed to the user.

#### FEATURE 4: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE

_As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online._

- **Scenario 1:** Show cached data when there's no internet connection.

  - **Given** the user has no internet connection,
  - **when** user goes to previously viewed events,
  - **then** cached data, stored inside the app, is provided to the user.

- **Scenario 2:** Display error when user changes any filter settings.

  - **Given** the user has no internet connection,
  - **when** the user changes the settings,
  - **then** "no internet" message is displayed.

#### FEATURE 5: ADD AN APP SHORTCUT TO THE HOME SCREEN

_As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can open the app faster._

- **Scenario 1:** User installs the app as a shortcut on their device home screen.

  - **Given** the user has wanted to open the app faster,
  - **when** the user selects to install the app as a shortcut,
  - **then** a shortcut is created on users homescreen.

#### FEATURE 6: DISPLAY CHARTS VISUALIZING EVENT DETAILS

_As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city._

- **Scenario 1:** A chart is displayed with the number of upcoming events in each city.

  - **Given** the main page has been opened,
  - **when** users selects chart view,
  - **then** a chart with the number of upcoming events for every city is displayed.

### Serverless Functions

In this project, serverless functions play a pivotal role in handling authorization for accessing public calendar events from the Google Calendar API.
Only authorized users can have access to view event data from the Google Calendar API, which is rendered in the React Meet App. This authorization is facilitated by serverless functions, which are a more efficient alternative to building and maintaining a full server for this purpose. In this context, serverless functions will generate and provide access tokens, ensuring secure access to the Google Calendar API. AWS Lambda is the chosen cloud-service provider for implementing these serverless functions, making the app's architecture more scalable and cost-effective.
